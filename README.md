# HotSpotStudio

Description: *Hot Spot Studio is a fun little toy that lets you create stunning  looking images. Place your "spotlights" on the work canvas and let  the program render the lights using its advanced lightning formulas.  You'll be surprised at how much fun it is to play with!*

This is a tiny Windows application I wrote in VB6 a long time ago. It was only intended for private use, so the source code is not the best quality. For more information and binary downloads go to: http://rlvision.com/spots/
