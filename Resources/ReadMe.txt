 About:

 Hot Spot Studio is a fun little toy that lets you create stunning 
 looking images. Place your "spotlights" on the work canvas and let 
 the program render the lights using its advanced lightning formulas. 
 You'll be surprised at how much fun it is to play with!
 

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Basic usage:
 
 o The work canvas is always empty on startup.
 
 o Simply click with the RIGHT mouse button on the canvas to 
   place a new spotlight there. Select and move lights with the LEFT
   mouse. Right click again to delete a light.
 
 o You can change the settings for each lights in the toolbox to 
   the left. Colour, size and intensity are all customizable.
   
 o Continue adding lights until you are satisfied.
 
 o Press the "Render Picture" button to create a high quality 
   rendering of the scene.
 
 o Save the image if you are satisfied, or go back to the "Design" 
   tab to further modify the canvas.

 Tips:

 o Some settings produce amazing lightning shows, others will result 
   in quite mediocre images. You should experiment with all kinds of 
   settings.

 o Light is additive, så dark background colours usually give better 
   result.

 o Lights with "Absorb similar colour" turned on look like ordinary 
   lights, but will produce interesting effects when near lights without 
   this turned on. My favourite is to make a row of lights with this 
   setting turned on on every other light.
 
 o Place large spotlights at the corners to fill up empty space and 
   make the picture more interesting.
